                <p>My husband passed away last year, and dealing with his workshop in the garage was something I just couldn't face alone. There were tools, projects, and memories everywhere. I didn't know where to start.</p>
                <p>The Clutter Command team was so gentle and understanding. They helped me decide what to keep, what my sons might want, and what could be donated to a local vocational school. They handled everything with care and respect.</p>
                <p>I can't say enough good things about this company. They helped me through one of the hardest tasks I've ever faced, and they did it with kindness and professionalism. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.</p>
